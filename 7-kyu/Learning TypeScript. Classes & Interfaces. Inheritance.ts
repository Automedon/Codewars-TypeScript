Description:
Learning TypeScript. Classes & Interfaces. Inheritance
Overview
Preloaded for you in this Kata is an interface IAnimal:

declare var IAnimal: {
  new (
    name: string,
    age: number,
    legs: number,
    species: string,
    status: string
  ): IAnimal;
}

interface IAnimal {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  legs: number;
  species: string;
  status: string;
  introduce: () => string;
}
Task
I. Animal
Define class Animal that implements IAnimal. The constructor function for Animal should accept 4 arguments in total in the following order: name, age, legs, species, status. Furthermore, the introduce() method for Animal should return string with the following content: Hello, my name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.

When done define the following classes that inherit from Animal using the extends keyword.

II. Shark
The constructor function for Shark should accept 3 arguments in total in the following order: name, age, status. All sharks should have a leg count of 0 (since they obviously do not have any legs) and should have a species of "shark".

III. Cat
The constructor function for Cat should accept the same 3 arguments as with Shark: name, age, status. Cats should always have a leg count of 4 and a species of "cat".

Furthermore, the introduce() method for Cat should be identical to the original introduce() except there should be exactly 2 spaces and the words "Meow meow!" after that. For example:

var example = new Cat("Example", 10, "Happy");
example.introduce() === "Hello, my name is Example and I am 10 years old.  Meow meow!"; // Notice the TWO spaces - very important
IV. Dog
The Dog constructor should accept 4 arguments in the specified order: name, age, status, master. master is the name of the dog's master which will be a string. Furthermore, dogs should have 4 legs and a species of "dog".

Dogs have an identical introduce() method as any other animal, but they have their own method called greetMaster() which accepts no arguments and returns "Hello (insert_master_name_here)" (of course not the literal string but replace the (insert_master_name_here) with the name of the dog's master).
